        Placeholder content for the Profile tab panel. This one relates to the profile tab. You got the finest architecture. Passport
        stamps, she's cosmopolitan. Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock. Never planned that one day I'd be losing you. She
        eats your heart out. Your kiss is cosmic, every move is magic. I mean the ones, I mean like she's the one. Greetings
        loved ones let's take a journey. Just own the night like the 4th of July! But you'd rather get wasted.

    <div class="tab-pane fade" id="nav-contact" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="nav-contact-tab">
        Placeholder content for the Contact tab panel. This one relates to the contact tab. Her love is like a drug. All my girls
        vintage Chanel baby. Got a motel and built a fort out of sheets. 'Cause she's the muse and the artist. (This is how we
        do) So you wanna play with magic. So just be sure before you give it all to me. I'm walking, I'm walking on air
        (tonight). Skip the talk, heard it all, time to walk the walk. Catch her if you can. Stinging like a bee I earned my
        stripes.
